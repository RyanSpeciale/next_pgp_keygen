This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# This is a project I have wanted to do for a while, there really is only a couple sites that generate PGP keys, of course you can generate them from your terminal, but this is for journalist's or reporter's who may need to transmit sensitive data, who are not tech savy. I plan to host this project on vercel for free.

# This project was bootstrapped with Create Next App, and was made with Next.js, and styled with Sass and Styled Components.

# Your are free to take this code and use it as your own as long as you leave the footer in, giving me my credit.

**Happy Coding**
